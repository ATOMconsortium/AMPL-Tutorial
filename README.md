# ATOM/AMPL

The ATOM Modeling PipeLine (AMPL; https://github.com/ATOMconsortium/AMPL) is an open-source, modular, extensible software pipeline for building and sharing models to advance in silico drug discovery.

This repository contains a collection of experimental AMPL tutorial COLAB notebooks. We suggest you the following order for AMPL tutorials:

* **Tutorial-00:** https://github.com/ravichas/AMPL-Tutorial/blob/master/00_BasicCOLAB_Tutorial.ipynb : Basic COLAB tutorial

* **Tutorial-01:** https://github.com/ravichas/AMPL-Tutorial/blob/master/01_Delaney_Example.ipynb (**Time: ~ 3 minutes**): This AMBL-COLAB notebook will take a public dataset of about 117 compounds with chemical properties and smiles strings. AMPL will read the data, curate, fit a RandomForest model to predict solubility and test the model. 

* **Tutorial-02:** https://github.com/ravichas/AMPL-Tutorial/blob/master/02_Delaney_Example.ipynb (**Mode: AMPL_GPU; Time: ~ 2 minutes**): This AMBL-COLAB notebook will take a public dataset of about 117 compounds with chemical properties and smiles strings. AMPL_GPU will read the data, curate, fit a RandomForest model to predict solubility and test the model.
