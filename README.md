# ATOM/AMPL

The ATOM Modeling PipeLine (AMPL; https://github.com/ATOMconsortium/AMPL) is an open-source, modular, extensible software pipeline for building and sharing models to advance in silico drug discovery.

This repository contains a collection of experimental AMPL tutorial COLAB notebooks. We suggest you the following order for AMPL tutorials:

* **Tutorial-00 (Basic COLAB Tutorial):** https://github.com/ravichas/AMPL-Tutorial/blob/master/00_BasicCOLAB_Tutorial.ipynb : Basic COLAB tutorial

* **Tutorial-01 (AMPL-COLAB setup):** https://github.com/ravichas/AMPL-Tutorial/blob/master/01_Install_AMPL_on_COLAB.ipynb : This COLAB notebook will install AMPL and save a copy of the installation files in your Google Drive for later use

* **Tutorial-01A (AMPL-GPU-COLAB setup):** https://github.com/ravichas/AMPL-Tutorial/blob/master/01A_Install_AMPL_GPU_on_COLAB.ipynb : This COLAB notebook will install GPU version of AMPL and save a copy of the installation files in Google Drive for later use.

* **Tutorial-02:** https://github.com/ravichas/AMPL-Tutorial/blob/master/02_Delaney_Example.ipynb : Prerequisite for this tutorial is https://github.com/ravichas/AMPL-Tutorial/blob/master/01_Install_AMPL_on_COLAB.ipynb. This COLAB notebook will use the pre-installed AMPL from your Google Drive. Make sure you run 01_Install_AMPL_on_COLAB.ipynb/01A_Install_AMPL_on_COLAB.ipynb before running this example. 

* **Tutorial-03:** https://github.com/ravichas/AMPL-Tutorial/blob/master/03_AMPL_Tutorial_GPU.ipynb : Prerequisite for this tutorial is . This COLAB notebook will retrieve AMPL installation from Google Drive. Please note that you need to have a Gmail account (personal account; institution Gmail account not tested).
