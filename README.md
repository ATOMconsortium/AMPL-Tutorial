# ATOM/AMPL

The ATOM Modeling PipeLine (AMPL; https://github.com/ATOMconsortium/AMPL) is an open-source, modular, extensible software pipeline for building and sharing models to advance in silico drug discovery.

This repository contains a collection of experimental AMPL tutorial COLAB notebooks. We suggest you the following order for AMPL tutorials:

* **Tutorial-00:** https://github.com/ravichas/AMPL-Tutorial/blob/master/00_BasicCOLAB_Tutorial.ipynb : Basic COLAB tutorial

* **Tutorial-01:** https://github.com/ravichas/AMPL-Tutorial/blob/master/01_Delaney_Example.ipynb (**Time: ~ 3 minutes**): This AMBL-COLAB notebook will take a public dataset of about 117 compounds with chemical properties and smiles strings. AMPL will read the data, curate, fit and test the model. 

* **Tutorial-03:** https://github.com/ravichas/AMPL-Tutorial/blob/master/03_AMPL_Tutorial_GPU.ipynb : Prerequisite for this tutorial is . This COLAB notebook will retrieve AMPL installation from Google Drive. Please note that you need to have a Gmail account (personal account; institution Gmail account not tested).
